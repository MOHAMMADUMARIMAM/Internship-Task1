# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Titanic dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks. The main goal is to transform raw data into a clean, structured format by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.

> 📌 No machine learning model is used — this project is only about data preprocessing and exploration.
